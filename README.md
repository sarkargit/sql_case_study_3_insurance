# Insurance Claims Analysis

This repository contains SQL queries designed to analyze insurance claims data, providing insights on various aspects of patient demographics, claims, and other relevant information. The purpose of these queries is to help identify trends, average claim amounts, and other key statistics that can inform business decisions or research in healthcare and insurance.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on querying an **Insurance** table that holds patient data including their **PatientID**, **age**, **BMI**, **region**, and other attributes like whether they are smokers or diabetic. The queries aim to provide answers to various questions about the data, such as:

- **Average Claim Amount by Region**
- **Maximum and Minimum BMI Values**
- **Claims and BMI Analysis for Smokers, Diabetics, and Other Groups**
- **Patient Rankings Based on Claim Amounts**
- **Age-wise Breakdown of Claims**
  
This project can be useful for analysts, researchers, or data scientists looking to gain deeper insights into healthcare-related insurance claim data.

## Features

### 1. **Basic Data Analysis**
- Retrieve all patient data.
- Calculate maximum and minimum BMI values for all patients.

### 2. **Claims and Demographic Insights**
- Find the average claim amount for patients in each region.
- Retrieve the average claim amount for patients based on their age or age group.
- Explore patients who have BMI values between certain ranges (e.g., between 40 and 50).

### 3. **Advanced Data Insights**
- Calculate the total claim amount for each patient, including comparisons to the average claim amount.
- Rank patients based on their claim amounts.
- Identify smokers in the dataset and provide insights on claims related to smoking and diabetes.

### 4. **BMI and Claim Trends**
- Analyze patients with BMI values higher than the average BMI for smokers.
- Group and analyze claims based on age ranges (Under 18, 18-30, 31-50, Over 50).

## Setup and Requirements

To run the queries in this repository, you will need the following:

- A **SQL database** with an `insurance` table (structure and sample data included in the project).
- **SQL client** or tool to run the queries (e.g., MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, SQL Server Management Studio, etc.).

### Example Database Setup

Assuming the `insurance` table has the following structure:

- **PatientID**: Integer (Primary Key)
- **Age**: Integer
- **BMI**: Float
- **Claim**: Float
- **Region**: Varchar
- **Smoker**: Varchar ('Yes' or 'No')
- **Diabetic**: Varchar ('Yes' or 'No')

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-claims-analysis.git
   ```

2. Import the database schema and data (ensure you have a database system like MySQL or PostgreSQL set up):
   - Create the `insurance` table based on the provided schema (adjust for your database).
   - Insert sample or real data into the table.

3. Execute the queries as required in your SQL environment to perform analysis on the data.

## Query Descriptions

Below is a brief description of each SQL query in this repository:

1. **Select all columns for all patients** – Retrieve all information from the `insurance` table.
2. **Display the average claim amount by region** – Calculate the average claim amount grouped by regions.
3. **Select the maximum and minimum BMI** – Identify the highest and lowest BMI values in the dataset.
4. **Patients with a BMI between 40 and 50** – Filter patients with BMI values within the specified range.
5. **Number of smokers in each region** – Count how many smokers exist in each region.
6. **Average claim for diabetic smokers** – Get the average claim amount for patients who are both diabetic and smokers.
7. **Patients with higher BMI than the average smoker BMI** – Filter smokers whose BMI is above the average BMI of smokers.
8. **Average claim amount for patients in each age group** – Calculate the average claim amount grouped by custom age ranges.
9. **Total claim for each patient with overall average claim** – Calculate the total claim for each patient with a comparison to the overall average claim.
10. **Top 3 patients with the highest claim amounts** – Retrieve the top 3 patients based on their claim amounts.
11. **Rank patients by claim amounts** – Rank all patients by their claim amounts.

### Notes:
- Replace `yourusername` in the GitHub URL with your actual GitHub username.
- You can add a `LICENSE` file if you intend to make the repository open-source.
- Feel free to modify the database schema in the instructions section to match your actual setup or sample data.

This should give anyone interested in using the repository a good idea of what it does and how to get started without needing to dive into the SQL code immediately.
